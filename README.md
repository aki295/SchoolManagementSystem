# SchoolManagementSystem
This is a project for training my skills in C# and .NET Framework.
I'm in the process of creating a School Managment Project, a useful system for language schools (both for the administration and the teaching staff).
The technologies, patterns and languages used: C#, jQuery, HTML5, Bootstrap, Entity Framework, LINQ, ASP.NET, MVC, Nunit + Moq for testing.
